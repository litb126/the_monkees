My first milestone project; front end page for the band The Monkees.

I will use the assets provided by the Code Institute using the github repo.

I am going to make the website with an easthetic that is in-keeping with the look of the band.
The look will be very clean with lots of white but I will also use small splashed of colour here and there.
I will take inspiration for the splashes of colour from the pictures of the band members and their outfits in the photos.

I want the website to be large in its appearance, using over the top icons but I still want it to look classy. 
I will do my best to tread the line of making sure that the band has an instantly big and colourful first appearance,
but at the same time making sure that the user does not feel overwhelmed. I hope to do this by keeping the elements of the page clear and concise.


My original wireframe images were to have the page as one long scrolling site, but having spent a bit of extra time on this, and considering this to be my first solo endeavour,
I will instead have a main index page with 4-5 pages.
Each page will have a specific purpose such as to showcase videos, songs, bios about the band members and a social media page for links to sites and for upcoming "gigs and tours" etc.

My only concern, at the start of this project, is that the imagery provided on github doesn't look to be of great quality. 
If I can source my own imagery and use some of my design skills to enhance it then I will do so.# the_monkees
